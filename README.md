# Fruit and Vegetable Classifier

This project classifies images of fruits and vegetables using deep learning techniques. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and contains various images of fruits and vegetables.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit
- Kaggle CLI (Command Line Interface)

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Fetching the Dataset

1. First, install the Kaggle CLI by running `pip install kaggle`.
2. Next, download the dataset from Kaggle using the following command:

```bash
kaggle datasets download nimapourmoradi/fruits-and-vegetables-image-mobilenetv2
```

3. Extract the downloaded zip file into a folder named `dataset`.

### Training the Model

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Image_Class_Model.ipynb` using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the dataset, build a convolutional neural network (CNN) using MobileNetV2, train the model, and save the trained model weights.

### Running the Streamlit App

To run the Streamlit app for classification, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will be accessible in your web browser, where you can upload images and get predictions from the trained model.
